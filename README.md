Benchmarking Generalist Vision-Language Models vs. Domain-Specific Foundation Models in Digital Pathology

## Description

This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of general-purpose multimodal models (such as CLIP, SAM, and GPT-4) with specialized models designed for histopathological image analysis. We focus on H&E-stained slides for classification and segmentation tasks, analyzing performance, scalability, and trade-offs.

## Goals

- Compare generalist and specialist models on histopathological datasets
- Benchmark classification and segmentation tasks
- Evaluate performance, data efficiency, and cost trade-offs
- Provide reproducible results and insights for the research community
